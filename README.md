# TRACE ROUTE with OPEN LAYERS

## Descritption

This is a small app made with NodeJs and Python. It runs the `traceroute` command and then takes the returned data and sends it to the IP API. This takes the IP address and returns GPS coordinates. Those coordinates are then sent to Open Layers and a map is created with a line drawn between the points.
