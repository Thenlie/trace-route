# TRACE ROUTE  ![Project License Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen)

## Descritption

This is a small app made with NodeJs and Python. It runs the `traceroute` command and then takes the returned data and sends it to the IP API. This takes the IP address and returns GPS coordinates. Those coordinates are then sent to Open Layers and a map is created with a line drawn between the points. 

## How To Use

Make sure to npm install:

* Inquirer
* Python-shell

Then you can run the program through node. You will be prompted to enter a URL. After some time an HTML page will be generated with a map and information about the trace route. 

## Tools Used

* NodeJS
* Python
* OpenLayers Maps
* IP API
